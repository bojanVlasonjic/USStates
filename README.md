# USStates
My first gui app in java. User enters the name of a US State in Serbian or English, and the program tells
him/her whether the country exists or not. There is the console and the GUI version of the program. The 
console version only supports the previously stated functionality, while in the GUI version the user can
also print out all the US countries and their capitals to a small text field. They can also remove it.

Note: the code is written in Serbian language
