# USStates
My first gui app in java using java swing. The purpose of the program is explained in the following: User enters the name of a US State in Serbian or English, and the program tells him/her whether the country exists or not. There is the console and the GUI version of the program. The console version only supports the previously stated functionality, while in the GUI version the user can also print out all the US countries and their capital cities to a small text field. They can also remove it.

Note: the code is written in Serbian language
